# HCI: Autonomous Vehicle Takeover Interface

An interactive interface design for managing the transition between autonomous and manual driving modes, prioritizing driver safety and reducing cognitive load during critical takeover scenarios.

## Overview

This project explores human-computer interaction principles in the context of autonomous vehicle control transitions. The interface uses a multi-tier visual hierarchy to communicate system state and urgency, ensuring drivers have complete transparency and can respond effectively to takeover requests.

## Key Features

**Interface Design & Usability**
- End-to-end design in Figma with interactive high-fidelity wireframes
- 3-tier visual hierarchy to reduce cognitive load during mode transitions
- Complex user interaction logic mapped for 100% system transparency between autonomous and manual modes

**UX Strategy & Urgency Communication**
- Color-coded alert system (Blue, Yellow, Red) to communicate "Time-to-Takeover" urgency
- Designed to minimize driver reaction time and cognitive overhead during critical transitions

## Getting Started
